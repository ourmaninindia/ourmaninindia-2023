Over the years I have written about issues, commented on events, or simply shared stories which I hope are worth sharing. For example, while rebuilding this website, I came across a story of a seminar I attended at THiNK in 2012. The topic of the lecture was *__The anatomy of an pandemic__* by Prof. Ian Lipkin! My last line was prophetic _"I cannot help but think we will hear of Dr Lipkin againâ€¦"._  Amazing when you read that blog again in the current context, the reason I featured it on the home page again below.
