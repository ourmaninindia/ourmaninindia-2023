## Introduction
The difference between a privacy policy and terms and conditions is that a privacy policy protects my users' rights, while terms and conditions protect this website or app's rights. Privacy policies outline how I interact with user data, and terms and conditions outline the rules for using this site.

This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information I collect, why I collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

* Assume good intentions. 
* Keep it civil, courteous and polite. 
* Don’t waste people’s time so do not spam. It will be rejected!

All comments require approval. I reserve the right to ban or suspend from this community anyone who cannot play by the rules. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.
