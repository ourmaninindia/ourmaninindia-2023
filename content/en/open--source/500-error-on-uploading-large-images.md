I noticed a strange error while uploading files. My server does not allow any file to be uploaded above the 128kb, even when the settings in /etc/php.ini are set to higher sizes.

After a lot of searching I managed to find the solution: add the following to the file /etc/httpd/conf.d/fcgid.conf :

    FcgidMaxRequestLen 1073741824

Donâ€™t forget to restart the apache server.
