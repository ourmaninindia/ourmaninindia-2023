I have a Sony home theatre and I have been bugged for ages as only some of my video files where showing up. A real bummer. After lots of searching and trying different programs, which all had some issue, I bumped into handbrake.

Before you try and install handbrake on Fedora 17 first install the following packages

    yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries" "X Software Development" "GNOME Software Development" yasm zlib-devel bzip2-devel fribidi-devel dbus-glib-devel libgudev1-devel webkitgtk-devel libnotify-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel
