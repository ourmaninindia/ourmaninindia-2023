Goa, where Vasco da Gama once landed only to be followed centuries later by Led Zeppelin, The Who and George Harrison, is a fascinating place with a constant influx of cosmopolitan thought. The former Portuguese colony is also known for its beaches, restaurant shacks with great food and low priced alcohol, and a relaxed lifestyle.

I like to call it home and it is a green oasis to recharge my batteries after frequent travels.
