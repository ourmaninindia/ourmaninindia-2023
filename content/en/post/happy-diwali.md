We wish you all a very happy Diwali and look forward to catch up soon again.

The first venue where we will be speaking will be the pre-Trade Mission meeting hosted by the EVD in the Hague. This mission is organised by the Chambers of Commerce of the five largest cities in the Netherlands.

After that there is the high level meeting of the Europe India Chamber of Commerce at the European Parliament on December 4. With the Indian economy continuing to do well there is ample to discuss and brainstorm. This years position paper is called “EU-India Trade Relations and Beyond: Dynamics of Mergers & Acquisitions and the Role of Corporate Governance”.
