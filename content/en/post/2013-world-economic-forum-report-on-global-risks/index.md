For those of us dealing with risk management, and who doesn’t these days, here is a link to the [2013 World Economic Forum Report on Global Risks](http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2013/ "2013 World Economic Forum Report on Global Risks").

This year’s findings show that the world is more at risk as persistent economic weakness saps our ability to tackle environmental challenges. The report highlights severe income disparity followed by unsustainable government debt (chronic fiscal imbalances) as the top two most prevalent global risks.
