### Goa’s Most Romantic Experience

The Solita is our own classic luxury yacht, available for exclusive charter cruises.  A completely different way of exploring Goa, the Solita will take you out to sea to spot dolphins and down Goa's secret backwaters, past quaint villages. Available at a priority booking to guests at Summertime Villa, this is an experience not to be missed.

Goa’s very first and till today, the most beautiful yacht for charter, the Solita is a 42-foot yacht in the classic Grand Banks style. With three decks, easy seating on the fly-bridge, a large lounge with well-equipped pantry and two beautifully-appointed teak wood cabins with en suite bathrooms, the Solita shows you Goa the way no one else can.

Watch dolphins and swim off the yacht in the mornings, or enjoy a cocktail watching Goa’s brilliant sunsets on a romantic evening cruise, the choice is yours.

With an experienced crew of four, the Solita has entertained international and Indian celebrities, including Amitabh Bachchan, Manisha Koirala and Vijay Mallya. The Solita is perfect for an exclusive holiday outing, and even better as a special gift on honeymoon.

The owners of Solita and Summertime Villa are the same. Which means you, as the guest of Summertime get preferred rates on this luxury yacht.

The charter means that the cruise will be exclusively for you and your guests –  you can bring up to 26  friends on board – or simply take her out for a splendid private cruise for two.

Let us know if you would like to sign on for this superb Goan experience! You can visit the Solita website by clicking <a href="www.solita.co.in" target="_blank">this link</a>, if you wish to see and know more about this grand lady.

The perfect spot for a peaceful holiday in Goa, Summertime is a luxury rental villa that sits on a nearly two-acre property on the gentle slope of a quiet hill outside Calangute. After only a year of operation it has already won the prestigious World Boutique Hotel Award!

Built in contemporary Asian style with Balinese influences, this luxurious villa is light, airy and utterly private, with a large infinity swimming pool and huge private gardens that give it a completely exclusive feel.

Peaceful but filled with birdsong, it is hard to believe Summertime’s postal address is Calangute! Landscaped gardens climb up and down the slopes of Summertime: there are fruit trees, a mini-walking garden, a koi pond, a waterfall and some fabulous views of a peaceful Goa, something that is increasingly difficult to find.

The secluded villa and the gardens are a bird-watcher’s delight, and flowering plants attract a number of butterflies and dragonflies. All this is within just a short drive from the villages of Calangute and Candolim with their beaches, huge number of restaurants, night-markets and entertainment.

At our villa in Goa space is a luxury in itself, so the three suites, all en-suite, are all a grand size, with a huge bathroom, a total of 730 sq feet each. Most rental holiday villas just have one bedroom that can be termed as the `Master’ bedroom, but with all three suites featuring the same, extremely generous size but different highlights – from a private garden to a four-poster bed – Summertime is perfect for three couples or a large family travelling together.

Done to a very high level of sophistication and elegance, the villa has high-quality furniture and artefacts, all designed so that it adds to the beauty of the land instead of standing out from it. Summertime is ideal for the discerning guest who wants the highest level of comfort, privacy and peace while on holiday in Goa.

You may want to extend your holiday in Goa by exploring different parts of India, either before or after you stay at Summertime.
