Internet neutrality is a big deal. It enables you, or anyone else, to complete at a true level playing field with large corporations.

Early last year Mark Zuckerberg had pushed to break net neutrality in India. It failed! Read here more about Facebook's biggest setback in [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg).

Now the FCC has a plan to destroy net neutrality in the USA. It's up to us to stop it.

John Oliver did his usual best recently to defend net neutrality, see his [great HBO episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak)
