On April 18 I did join the very interesting Diversity & Inclusion seminar courtesy the ABN-AMRO bank and the Free University (VU). Chaired by Charles Groenhuijsen, the presentation by Prof. Yvonne Benschop (Nijmegen Uni) was particularly interesting. Also noteworthy was Francoise Companjen’s (VU Uni) reference to Richard Florida ‘s findings that “people in technology businesses are drawn to places known for diversity of thought and open-mindedness, and that our measures potentially get at a broader concept of diversity and inclusiveness.” (Richard Floirda & Gary Gates).
