Sonali Chatterjee of the *Indian Ports & Infrastructure* magazine did a Q&A with me some time back which appeared in their February issue. I have created a pdf of the relevant article for you to [read](https://images.ourmaninindia.com/Ports-Infrastructure.pdf).


*This publication has appeared in the [Indian Ports & Infrastructure](http://www.ports-mag.com/) magazine of February 2012.*
