On behalf of Odyssey Tours I was pleased to collect the World Boutique Hotel award which this year was held at the Merchant Taylor's Hall in London, November 9, 2016. Read more about it [here](https://www.boutiquehotelawards.com/luxury-hotels/summertime-villa).

It was an interesting night at a fascinating old building in Threadneedle St, Cornhill, which is in the heart of London. I had arrived on the Eurostar via Brussels so I did not have far to go. The Merchant Taylors' Hall is the seat of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, one of the Twelve Great Livery Companies of the City of London surviving from Mediaeval times. A beautiful place and quite fitting considering it was an awards evening of boutique hotels worldwide. A black tie dinner seemed totally in place.

After a glass of champagne on arrival the evening became a great networking event for the who-is-who in the boutique hotel business. I represented our Summertime Villa in Goa which is stunning. However, the properties of some of the other award winners really blew me. There was one property which required a private jet...
