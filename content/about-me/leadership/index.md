I was born in the sixties. No surprise perhaps I enjoyed reading Kerouc's _'On the Road'_, Steinbeck's _'Travels with Charlie'_, Michener's _'The Drifters'_, and for that matter most of Hemingway's books. The members of the Beat Generation developed a reputation as new bohemian hedonists, who celebrated non-conformity and spontaneous creativity. I relate to that quite a bit though instead of a Dharma Bum, I am much more a Happy Warrior.  


<blockquote>Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,<br>
Healthy, free, the world before me,<br>
The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose. </blockquote>


As a teenager hitch-hiking around Europe and staying on a kibbutz taught me that along the journey one will face the test of wisdom. My LinkedIn profile shows my professional journey. Looking back I really enjoyed the various experiences. Whether it was co-founding a succeful travel company during my student days in Australia, running a global high profile project from Shell headquarters, or sitting on the Board restructuring a 1200+ staff listed engineering company in India. 


The beats are generally anti-academic. Yet I wholeheartedly embrace academics. Not only did I complete my B.Sc., studying Finance and attending INSEAD and Harvard was exciting. Setting up an e-learning portal last year, it was a no brainer for me to use one jointly develped by Harvard and MIT. I also attended an academic conference on customer services in Singapore and made some good friends.

What is it that really drives me? Lifelong learning! How well you perform in the workplace is governed by four factors: competencies, experiences, traits, and drivers. Research shows these four areas to be highly predictive of performance differences and correlated with all key talent variables: engagement, retention, productivity, leadership effectiveness, and leadership potential. 

Allons!


<blockquote>From this hour I ordain myself loosâ€™d of limits and imaginary lines,<br>
Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,<br>
Listening to others, considering well what they say,<br>
Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,<br>
Gently,but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me.<br>
I inhale great draughts of space,<br>
The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine. </blockquote>
