I use xsane which needs to be added as well as some other development packages

    yum install xsane gcc cups-devel python-devel libusb-devel libtool libjpeg-turbo-devel qt4 qt4-devel pyqt4 pyqt4-devel dbus-devel

Run hp-check to see if you have all the required packages covered

    hp-check

I still havenâ€™t got my scanner to work
