You use a Postfix setup with amavisd-new and get the following errors in your mail log:

>status=deferred (connect to 127.0.0.1[127.0.0.1]:10024: Connection refused)

The solution is to restart both amavisd-new and Postfix and then check with

    netstat -tap

that both are running on the ports 25 and 10025 (postfix) and 10024 (amavisd-new).
