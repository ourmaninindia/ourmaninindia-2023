The agility that Open Source produces is tremendous but only as effective as the skills of your top IT person. The learning curve is steep but tremendously rewarding.

I have collected here a repository of code and other material that I have struggled with at some stage or the other. I hope it is of use. Enjoy and do spread the word of Linux.
