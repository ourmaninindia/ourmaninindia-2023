Alfred Cornelis Tuinman (born 24 July 1960) is a  Dutch management consultant who spent many years working in Australia, India, and the Netherlands. 

*Education and professional life*
Tuinman was born in Huizen in the province of North Holland, in a Dutch Reformed family, but would stay there less than a year. He is the middle child of Kornelis Tuinman (15 October 1922 â€“ Nov 2001), a bookkeeper, and Johanna Wilhemnina Meerman (born 17 September 1924).

Tuinman grew up though in Soest and spent much time helping out on the nearby farm of Dirk Lam. When he was 15, his parents moved to Haarlem where his father became the administrator cum verger of the famous St Bavo cathedral in the centre of town. Living in the church was an exciting time and he appeared briefly as an extra in the Dutch movie Max Havelaar. Tuinman attended Mendel College specialising in sciences. He then joined d'Witte Leli in Amsterdam. Keen to complete his studies, during the second semester he successfully completed the first and second year. During the summers Tuinman would hitch-hike around Europe and Israel.

In February 1981, aged 20, Tuinman emigrated with his elder brother Hans to Sydney, Australia. He attended New South Wales University and obtained his Bachelor degree in Zoology. During his studies Tuinman and his brother, who studied Indian history, set up Odyssey Tours Pty Ltd as a travel company focussing on adventure travel to India. They did not shy away from organising special interest tours to Europe for Adult Education centres. In 1993 Tuinman moved to India to continue the operations from there. 

In 2002, there was a negative travel advise to India (over ![the India-Pakistan standoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_standoff)) which caused their baby daughter to be born in the Netherlands. Her medical issued kept the family in the Netherlands and Tuinman studied Financial Controlling at the HES in Amsterdam. Subsequently he worked as a management consultant for Shell and ING Bank before being recruited back to India in 2008. There he set up a steel plate plant on behalf of the Dutch Central Industries Groep NV (CIG) in Groningen. Hired as the CFO, he became CEO within a year. CS India Steel Pvt Ltd was specialised in cutting and cold forming of steel plates for the marine industry. The financial crisis made it imperitive to sell the plant which he did so succesfully making himself redundant. Prior to that he had set up Nupas Cadmatic India Pvt Ltd as an offshore software development centre for his sister concern NCG BV (later Cadmatic BV). Upon hearing of his availability, liqor baron Vijay Mally requested him to join his UB Group. Tuinman became Executive Director Commercial at UB Engineering Ltd, a BSE listed company, to oversee the company's daily functioning. The situation was much worse then projected to the Board and a year later the complete Board had resigned and the sitting MD was jailed.

After this turbulent period, Tuinman took a sabatical to ensure that their son could join TU Delft to study aerospace engineering. That mission succeeded. In September 2018 Tuinman joined Cadmatic BV, by now in Finnish hands, in Groningen as Director Global Customer Services & Groningen site. A difference in vision made him leave the company in February 2020.
